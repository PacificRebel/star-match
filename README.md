# star-match
React app with basic 'reactful' template, webpack and babel pre-installed.

Create with: `npx reactful star-match`  
Guide: jscomplete.com/learn/1rd-reactful  

`npm start` will run two concurrent commands: Webpack and the server in the backend.  

It runs on localhost:1234 by default (it's meant to be 4242 but not on mine!).
